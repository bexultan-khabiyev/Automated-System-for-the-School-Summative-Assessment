# About the project
The project aims to create an online system that enables students to submit papers and allows teachers to assess them. This system comprises a user-friendly website and an extensive database.

The advantages of the new system compared to traditional in-school assessments are outlined below:
 • The assessment duration is reduced by approximately 20%
 • All student-submitted work is centralized and stored in a single file system, simplifying access and backup
 • Typed texts written by students are typically more legible than handwritten ones, making it easier for teachers to evaluate them

The website's interface was constructed using Bootstrap 4.0, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. SQL and PHP were employed to manage the system's database and implement its main functionalities.

Regrettably, the website cannot be accessed anymore, as it requires the admin to initiate an Apache HTTP server.
